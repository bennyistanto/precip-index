## Overview

This user guide provides comprehensive documentation for using the **precip-index** package to calculate climate indices and analyze extreme events.

## Contents

### Climate Indices

Learn how to calculate and interpret standardized indices:

- **[SPI - Standardized Precipitation Index](spi.qmd)**
  - Precipitation-based drought monitoring
  - Multiple time scales (1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months)
  - Distribution fitting and calibration

- **[SPEI - Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index](spei.qmd)**
  - Water balance approach (precipitation - PET)
  - Temperature-inclusive drought assessment
  - PET calculation methods

### Analysis Methods

Understand the analytical framework:

- **[Run Theory for Climate Extremes](runtheory.qmd)**
  - Event identification methodology
  - Duration, magnitude, intensity, peak
  - Time-series monitoring
  - Gridded period statistics

- **[Magnitude Types Explained](magnitude.qmd)**
  - Cumulative (monotonic) magnitude
  - Instantaneous (variable) magnitude
  - When to use each type

- **[Visualization Guide](visualization.qmd)**
  - 11-category WMO color scheme

## Getting Started

If you're new to the package:

0. Read **[Data Model & Outputs](../get-started/data-model.qmd)** to confirm your data contract and understand return formats
1. Start with the **[SPI Guide](spi.qmd)** to understand basic index calculation
2. Move to **[Run Theory](runtheory.qmd)** to learn event analysis
3. Explore **[Visualization](visualization.qmd)** to create plots

For hands-on learning, try the [Tutorials](../tutorials/01-calculate-spi.qmd).

## Key Concepts

### Standardized Indices

Both SPI and SPEI transform precipitation (and evapotranspiration) data into standardized values that represent probability of occurrence:

- **Positive values:** Wetter than normal
- **Negative values:** Drier than normal
- **Magnitude:** Severity of the condition

### Bidirectional Analysis

This package treats dry and wet extremes equally:

- **Droughts:** Use negative thresholds (e.g., -1.2)
- **Wet events/Floods:** Use positive thresholds (e.g., +1.2)
- **Same functions:** Consistent methodology for both

### Time Scales

Different time scales capture different drought types:

- **1-3 months:** Meteorological/agricultural
- **6-9 months:** Agricultural/hydrological
- **12-24 months:** Hydrological/socio-economic
