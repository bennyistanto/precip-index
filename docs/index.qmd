# Monitor Climate Extremes with Confidence

A minimal, efficient Python implementation of **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** and **Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)** for monitoring **both drought and wet conditions** using run theory.

## Key Features

::: {.grid-container}
::: {.feature-card}
### 📊 Climate Indices

- **SPI** - Standardized Precipitation Index
- **SPEI** - Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index
- Multiple time scales (1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months)
- CF-compliant NetCDF output
:::

::: {.feature-card}
### 🌡️ Bidirectional Analysis

- Monitor **drought** (dry conditions)
- Monitor **floods** (wet conditions)
- Unified framework for both extremes
- Consistent methodology
:::

::: {.feature-card}
### 📈 Run Theory Implementation

- Event identification & characterization
- Duration, magnitude, intensity, peak
- Time-series monitoring
- Gridded period statistics
:::

::: {.feature-card}
### 🎨 Visualization Suite

- Time series plots with event highlighting
- 11-category SPI/SPEI classification
- Spatial maps of event characteristics
- 5-panel evolution timelines
:::

## Quick Example

Here's how easy it is to calculate SPI and identify drought events:

```python
import xarray as xr
from indices import spi
from runtheory import identify_events, calculate_timeseries
from visualization import plot_index, plot_events

# Load precipitation data
ds = xr.open_dataset('precipitation.nc')
precip = ds['precip']

# Calculate SPI-12
spi_12 = spi(precip, scale=12, periodicity='monthly')

# Identify drought events (threshold -1.2)
events = identify_events(spi_12.isel(lat=0, lon=0), threshold=-1.2)

# Visualize
plot_index(spi_12.isel(lat=0, lon=0), threshold=-1.2)
```

## What Makes This Package Different?

::: {.callout-note}
## Bidirectional by Design

Unlike traditional drought-only tools, **precip-index** treats dry and wet extremes equally. Use negative thresholds for droughts, positive thresholds for floods - same functions, same methodology.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Optimized for Scale

Built for global-scale gridded data with CF conventions. Efficiently processes large datasets using NumPy, SciPy, and Numba acceleration.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Run Theory Framework

Goes beyond simple threshold exceedance. Implements full run theory to characterize event duration, magnitude (cumulative & instantaneous), intensity, and peak values.
:::

## Example Applications

- **Operational Drought Monitoring** - Track ongoing droughts with real-time updates
- **Flood Risk Assessment** - Identify wet extremes and excess precipitation
- **Climate Impact Studies** - Analyze historical trends in extremes
- **Early Warning Systems** - Generate alerts based on evolving event characteristics
- **Decision Support** - Gridded statistics for regional planning

## Real Data Example

This package includes example data from **Bali, Indonesia** (1958-2024) using TerraClimate:

## Try it with your data

The tutorials use real TerraClimate data included in the repository. Follow along with actual climate data, not synthetic examples!
