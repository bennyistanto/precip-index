## [2026.1] - January 2026

### Initial Release

First public release of the precip-index package — a streamlined Python implementation for calculating SPI and SPEI climate indices with comprehensive event analysis capabilities.

### Core Features

**Climate Indices**

- SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index)
- Multi-scale support: 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months
- Five probability distributions: Gamma, Pearson III, Log-Logistic, GEV, Generalized Logistic
- Automatic PET calculation from temperature (Thornthwaite method)
- Parameter save/load for operational workflows
- CF-compliant NetCDF output with customizable metadata

**Run Theory Analysis**

- Event identification for both dry (drought) and wet (flood) conditions
- Dual magnitude tracking: cumulative and instantaneous
- Gridded period statistics for decision support
- Event characteristics: duration, magnitude, intensity, peak, inter-arrival

**Visualization**

- WMO standard 11-category classification
- Time series plots with event highlighting
- Spatial statistics maps
- Cross-distribution comparison charts

### Technical Highlights

- Modular architecture: `indices.py`, `runtheory.py`, `distributions.py`, `visualization.py`
- Centralized configuration via `config.py`
- Memory-efficient chunked processing for global-scale data
- NumPy vectorization with Numba JIT compilation
- Robust fitting with automatic fallback chains (L-moments → Method of Moments → MLE)
- Data diagnostics and goodness-of-fit testing

### Documentation

- Comprehensive user guides for SPI, SPEI, run theory, and magnitude concepts
- Technical documentation: methodology, distributions, implementation, API reference
- Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials
- Quick start guide and configuration reference

---

## Future Releases

- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Additional test coverage
- Enhanced documentation and examples
- Community-requested features
